As a rule, animations should follow the following scheme:

"CurrentAnimation" is the variable name that controls the currently playing animation

//0-10 -- BASE ANIMATIONS
//These are common and should be consistent across all character/enemy types.
//If an enemy doesn't have a run animation (for example), the same animation can be used
//whether CurrentAnimation is 1 or 2. Static enemies might always fall back to CurrentAnimation 0

0 -- Idle state
1 -- Walking
2 -- Running

3 -- Jumping
4 -- Falling

5 --
6 -- 
7 -- 

8 -- Being Hit

9 -- Death (Basic)

10-99 (but ideally less than 15...) - used for abilities

100+ - used for special actions; NPCs emoting, monsters idling, players climbing ladders or checking their phone, etc


I really, really don't want to deal with more animations than this. If it gets to the point where I need more than this, I'm switching to 3D characters.
